'Manner' is an AR divination experience application, with the ancient China divination technique thinking to help the modern era Gen-Z people break their choice phobia, help them find their answer easily.


‘Manner’ focus on random and change as nature, imitating nature in its manner of operation.


In terms of design, 'Manner' explores the interaction between computational thinking and ancient China divination technique, trying to be inspired both conceptually and morphologically. Augmented reality adds more attractive user experience, generating new times divination experience. How to make the combination of divination and digital more interesting and naturally is the focus of design consideration.

Divination is a globalized, time-honoured, and diverse cultural ritual, ancient Chinese people had developed divination 3600 years ago as recorded. 



3600 years ago, ancient Chinese people had their divination method which could help them make choices; How will modern people in the digitalized era after 3600 years find their solutions– this study should be understood to sit in this meta-timeline.



I Ching, is the ancient Chinese divination symbol represented, known as the other name 'the Book of Change' so the I Ching could be understood as ‘the philosophy of change’ which also is the project ‘Manner’ inspired from.



How the ancient I Ching divination process works:

1.	Asking the question in your mind.

2.	Shaking three coins in your palms

3.	Flipping three coins in your hand

4.	Flipping six times overall

5.	Observing patterns and getting your hexagram

6.	Let an I Ching master interpret the hexagram



After these six steps, the questioner acquires that question answer. In fact, the first five steps are not extra limited to complete, the sixth step is the most critical one – reading the hexagram result. However, only a few people are truly proficient in I Ching. It is not easy to find an I Ching expert to explain what you expected. Obviously, this is not an everyday implementation.



‘Manner’ is an extension to the study of modern divination. How to read it in a modern way? So, the problem now is how to make the understanding part make sense and make the connection naturally. 



The final solution is to let the computer receive, read, understand, and feedback to the questioner.



Barcode is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. 2D barcodes can be read by a digital camera connected to a microcomputer.



Barcodes are not just attached to products, but also store and transform information. I Ching is an unknown code language to most people who never learned, the barcode is a kind of unknown code to people but computers could read and understand (Moreover, barcode have a sort of connection with binary). 



Both barcode graphics and I Ching hexagram graphics are composed of lines, which contains their own laws. There is a wonderful connection between the lines from ancient China and the lines from modern production. 



The product logic of 'Manner'： sets the I Ching hexagrams as the inputs and the corresponding answer barcodes as the output.



How the ‘Manner’ divination process works:

1.	Asking the question in your mind.

2.	Clicking mouse for a random colourful I Ching hexagram

3.	Opening the ‘Manner’ app

4.	Scanning the colourful I Ching hexagram

5.	Receiving the generated AR barcode

6.	Tapping ‘Read Your Result’ and taking the answer
